# Emoji Selector (for Gnome) ["Dash to panel" branch]
This basic Gnome shell extension provides a simple popup menu with some emojis in it ; Clicking on an emoji copies it to your clipboard.

## New features
Version 2 :
- new way to display emojis, on a grid (which is far better)

Version 3 :

- less ugly code

## Installation
The better option is to install it from extensions.gnome.org (where there is only version 1 at the moment i write this)

> How to manually install the extension ?

Download files and put them in an "emoji-selector@maestroschan.fr" folder to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/

You may need to restart the gnome shell environnment ("logout and login again", or alt+f2 + r + enter).

> The screenshot looks great but it's ugly on my computer !

It will be less ugly if you have the « Twitter Color Emoji » font, or the « EmojiOne Color » font installed on your system. These fonts are on github.

## Your eventual observations :
> The "recently used" category is reset every time i login, is this normal ?

Yes, sorry, i'm glad this feature works, so i haven't already think about how to make it remember what you used.

> Can you translate the extension in [some language] ?

The extension is currently available in english, french and german. I only know french and english, so if you need a specific language, please contribute : you just have to be inspired by the existing .po files !

> There is no racialized smileys / LGBT peoples / gender-specific activities / "numbers in square" symbols :'(

I'm sorry about that, but most fonts have a bad technical support for these caracters, which didn't display well (at least on my computer), so i prefered doing without these emojis.
